# Example code repository

This code has been produced for the purposes of modelling ____ as part of the _____. It is available under the open source MIT licence and we hope that others will be able to study and reuse its components. However, we make no claims about the suitability of using the code or its components outside of the very strict circumstances in which it is being used in the ____. In particular, we would like to make clear that we consider that the code should NOT be used in the following circumstances:

* The code should NOT be used within the ____ as any part of formal or informal decision making - any use of this code within this project is to be carried out solely by the project team under controlled circumstances
* The code should NOT be used outside of the formal methodology that is in use around this project with respect to the setting of parameters and the interpretation of outputs. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Access to and attendance at comprehensive training, as detailed HERE ADD LINK
    * Support throughout the process of setting assumptions for the model
    * Support throughout the process of interpreting the outputs, including dedicated workshops to explore the outputs and follow up support
    * Participation in the process with the project team of co-authoring a report detailing the process around assumption settting, a detailed description of the outputs and their interpretation, consideration of possible scenarios including ranges of parameters and the distribution of model runs, and any other local considerations that are relevant to the modelling processes

The project team do not recommend that the model in this code is used in whole or in part outside of these conditions and, further to the conditions of the licence, accept no liability in cases where the code is used without these conditions.
